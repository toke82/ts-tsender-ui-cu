1. Create a basic react/nextjs application
2. Connect our wallet, with a nicer connect application
3. Implement this function
```javascript
function airdropERC20(
    address tokenAddress, // ERC20 token
    address[] calldata recipients,
    uint256[] calldata amounts,
    uint256 totalAmount
)
```
4. e2e testing
    1. When we connected, we see the form
    2. When disconnected, we don't
5. Deploy to fleek
